### ➡️ Reading files, Writing files
- Python provides built-in functions for creating, writing, and reading files.
- Two types of files can be handled in Python,
  1. Normal text files
  2. Binary files (written in binary language, 0s, and 1s).


### ➡️ Text files
- in this type of file, the data is stored in ASCII form or text form.
- Each line of text is terminated with a special character called EOL (End of Line), which is the new line character (‘\n’).

 
### ➡️ Binary files
- In this type of file, the data is stored in machine-understandable binary language (0's and 1's).
- They do not have any newline character at the end of any line (like '\n' in text files).
